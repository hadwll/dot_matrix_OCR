## OCR Recognition for dot matrix style print

This repo forms the hand in for an Msc project, the deliverable was a working project to demonstrate a pervasive computing application.

The project focuses on the technology required to correctly classify dot matrix style print.

The code to train the model is is contained in the train folder it is required to be carried out on hardware capable of training a CNN.

The code that runs on a raspberry pi is contained in the pi folder, you need a 64bit OS to run tensorflow on the pi, 
one of the many many things I learned which compleating this task.

This was my first application involving a vision system.
